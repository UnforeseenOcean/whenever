Whenever
========

An interpretator for the esoteric language [Whenever](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/whenever.html).
It should be fairly complete, however there are some known limitations (mostly due to lack of test code):

* "Most standard mathematical functions" missing
* Floating point numbers not handled

Inspired by Sarah Groff-Palermo's Javascript [version](https://github.com/sarahgp/talking-to-machines/blob/master/examples/whenever.js).
